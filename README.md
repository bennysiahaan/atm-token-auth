# atm-token-auth
An implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA) for ATM security system improvement. This is implemented using Arduino IDE.

A security system project using digital watch as the authentication device. You can have a good look of the device [here](https://github.com/bennysiahaan/atm-token-auth/tree/master/img).

The OTP generated by the hardware is used when the authentication takes place.
